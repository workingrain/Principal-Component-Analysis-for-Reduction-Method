# Principal-Component-Analysis-for-Reduction-Method

#### PROPOSAL OF QUESTION
How do the principal components derived from patient data contribute to the variance in hospital admissions and associated costs?
#### DEFINED GOAL
This analysis aims to identify key patient profiles based on demographic and financial characteristics using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This enables the hospital to develop targeted interventions and personalized care plans to improve patient outcomes and optimize resource utilization. 
#### EXPLANATION OF PCA
PCA is a statistical method used for dimensionality reduction. First, PCA starts by standardizing the data with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step ensured that all variables contributed equally to the analysis, regardless of their scale. Then, PCA calculates the covariance matrix, which shows the relationship between each pair of variables. Afterward, PCA performs eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix. Then, PCA selects the principal components based on their corresponding eigenvalues. Typically, principal components are sorted in descending order of eigenvalues, so the first few components capture the most variance in the data. The original data is then transformed into the new coordinate system defined by the principal components. Each observation is represented by scores along each principal component. Lastly, PCA provides insights into how variables contribute to the variance in the data. It allows for identifying patterns, clusters, or groups of observations with similar characteristics. 
The expected outcomes are the identification of key variables and insights into relationships. PCA identifies the key variables that contribute the most to the variability in the dataset. This enables the identification of critical factors driving patient characteristics and hospital admissions. Moreover, PCA reveals relationships and patterns among variables, which helps uncover underlying structures in the data. 
#### PCA ASSUMPTION
An assumption of PCA is that there are linear relationships between the variables in the dataset. If the relationships are highly non-linear, PCA may not effectively capture the underlying structure of the data. Therefore, assessing the linearity of relationships between variables is essential before applying PCA. 
#### SUMMARY OF DATA ANALYSIS
For both cases of retaining 3 and 4 principal components, PC1 explains the highest among of variance of 28.41% in the data. This is the most significant portion of the variance captured by a single component. As more principal components are included, the total variance explained increases. In the case of retaining four components, the total variance explained rises to 73.07% compared to 58.90% for 3 components. Adding PC4 provides an additional 14.17% variance, contributing to a higher total variance explained overall.
This analysis reveals that the principal components derived from patient data explain a significant portion of the variance in hospital admissions and associated costs. By applying PCA, I could reduce the dimensionality of the original dataset while retaining the most critical information. Retaining the first 3 principal components (PC1, PC2, and PC3), which collectively explain 58.89% of the total variance, captures a substantial amount of the variability present in the data. This dimensionality reduction approach can represent complex patient data using a smaller set of uncorrelated components while preserving a considerable amount of the relevant information. 
It is crucial to specifically focus on the PC1 which captures the most underlying factor influencing hospital admission cost. Subsequent principal components capture additional variance that can provide further insight.
Overall, the analysis demonstrates that PCA is a valuable tool for understanding the complex relationship between patient data and hospital costs. These insights can give healthcare providers an overall better understanding, leading to more efficient resource allocation or improved patient care strategies.
